# Tether-Documentation
This is a repository in which you are to add tether documentation and simultaneously start learning Git.
Note- This is not the final documentation so experiment but take care not to delete anything.
The file name Tether_latex.tex stands for my learning of Latex. It might not be upto the mark so suggest changes.
While adding any file a contributor should name the commit "Adding file_name" with relevance.
While making a change name commit "Changing file_name1 file_name2 " with the changes you made.
