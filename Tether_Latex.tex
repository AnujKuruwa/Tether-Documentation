Electrodynamic Tether Basics and Applications
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Electrodynamic Tether Basics}
 A tether literally means a cable used for support. An electrodynamic tether(EDT) is a device 
which works only in the Low Earth Orbits(LEO). It is based on Lenz's law which states that
in a region of magnetic field, a moving conducting body experiences a force which opposes the cause 
of flow of currrent in the conductor.
